## 🧰 Skills & Techniques Used

### 🎛️ **Pivot Tables**
I built multiple pivot tables to summarize sales by:
- Year 
- Age Group
- Country
- Order Quality

These pivot tables help extract insights from the dataset efficiently.

### 📈 Vizualizing Pivot Tables
I presented the pivot table as a graphical chart to visualize the summarized data, making it easier to interpret trends and comparisons, and assist in analysis and decision making.

### 🧩 **Slicers**
Interactive slicers were added to allow quick filtering of pivot table results, improving the usability of the report.
